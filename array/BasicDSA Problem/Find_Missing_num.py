# Find the Missing Number
# Last Updated : 19 Apr, 2025
# Given an array arr[] of size n-1 with distinct integers in the range of [1, n]. This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with one element missing. Find the missing element in the array.

# Examples: 

# Input: arr[] = [8, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7, 1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 8 are present except 6.

# Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Here the size of the array is 4, so the range will be [1, 5]. The missing number between 1 to 5 is 4

def find_missing_num(arr):
    n= len(arr)+1

    for i in range(1,n+1):
        found = False
        for j in range(n-1):
            if arr[j] == i:
                found = True
                break

        if not found:
            return i
    return -1

arr= [1, 2, 3, 5]
